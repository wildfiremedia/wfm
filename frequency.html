<h3>Frequency</h3>
<p>It refers to how often how you distribute to your target area.</p>
<p>This is <b>very important</b>.</p>
<p>You must be consistent with your flyer distribution.  Your flyers can and do generate immediate response, but a <b>large part of flyer distribution</b> is building <b>Brand Awareness</b>.</p>
<p>That's why you tend to see the same ads over and over in magazines and on television.</p>
<p>Branding isn’t built within a day. Through regular and on-going distribution of flyers you are continuing to build up your brand awareness:</p>
<p>If people receive your flyer every month or two you will become memorable. They will think of you first when they want what you are selling, and they may also recommend you to friends and family having seen your flyer often.</p>
<p>Furthermore, psychologists have shown that familiarity induces liking. When people like you, they are more likely to want to use your products/services.</p>
<p>Besides Frequency, you should also consider your <b>Target Area.</b></p>

<h3>Target Area</h3>
<p>You want to target an area that will generate more response and customer conversions.</p>
<p>A simple rule of thumb is to target people with the desire for your service and the financial means.</p>

<h3>Your Budget</h3>
<p>Finally, you should consider your budget.</p>
<p>The ideal situation is to be able to distribute your flyers throughout your Target Area, and at a reasonable Frequency.  But sometimes your budget may not allow you to do so. Therefore, you have to do the best you can.</p>
<p>A simple advice:</p>
<p>If you have a really wide Target Area, we would never recommend you blanket them in one go. It’s more effective for you to deliver to certain areas at least 3 times to get your message across to customers.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is to distribute on a reasonable frequency. Too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Instead you create a negative impression.</p>
