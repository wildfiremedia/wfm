<h3>Advertising flyer mistake #1: Using your business name or category as your headline</h3>

<p>Remember, your flyer is an ad, not a business card. It needs to sell. Your potential customers aren't interested in your name. They're not even interested in what you do. They're interested in their own needs and wants. So, hit them with a headline they can't ignore.
<br/>Try: </p>
<p>‘Have A Bikini Body By [WHEN]’ looks really good to someone who wants to lose weight. It sets a goal, and reflects their desire. Certainly much better than ‘Lose Weight With Us’</p>
<p>‘You’re Paying TOO MUCH Interest On Your Home Loan’ is a statement that will provoke far more curiosity in a cash-strapped family than ‘Come To Cut Price Home Loans’</p>

<p>You get the idea. Use your headline to hit them hard.</p>

<h3>Advertising flyer mistake #2: Listing services instead of raising problems and solving them</h3>
<p>Tip: research has repeatedly shown that people are more averse to pain than attracted to reward.</p>
<p>Think about all the problems, both real and potential, that could come from not using your product or service. Put yourself in your customer's shoes. Talk to them if you can.</p>
<p>Emphasize in your flyer copy the problems and solutions that set you apart from your competition.</p>

<h3>Advertising flyer mistake #3: Closing passively</h3>
<p>This is the typical close to a flyer: "for more information, call 0000-0000." That's passive. Instead, make an offer to motivate action and close the deal!</p>
<p>Here are four basic, proven closers:</p>
<p><b>Buy before (DATE), and receive $10 off.</b></p>
<p>This closer is effective at getting immediate action, and works especially well for businesses offering products/services that are one-time purchases.</p>

<p><b>Come in before (DATE), and get a coupon good for 10% off your next purchase!</b></p>
<p>This closer only rewards a customer when they return, which helps you build a regular clientele. You can even delay the reward, but the longer it's put off the bigger it must be.</p>
<p>For example, a housecleaning service might offer as an incentive the fifth cleaning free (essentially a 20% discount off five cleanings). Note, too, that the word "FREE" is a powerful attractor.</p>
<p>Act before (DATE), and get (VALUE-ADDED PRODUCT/SERVICE), FREE with your purchase!</p>
<p>This closer doesn't diminish the value of your basic product or service, but it still offers an incentive for fast action. It also works that word "free" into your flyer.</p>
<p>If your business offers products/services that are regularly purchased (food, household items, hair cutting, lawn mowing, etc.), this offer exposes new customers to an "extra" that may turn into a regular purchase.</p>

<p><b>Book before (DATE) to take advantage of our slow-season schedule and prices!</b></p>
<p>This closer flips the offer around, and essentially attaches a negative consequence to any delay or hesitation. Remember the tip about people being more averse to pain than attracted to reward?</p>
<p>Similar closers can include limits on availability or quantity ("Offer limited to the first 25 customers, so call now!"). Note: the more-believable the reason for the limit, the more powerful this closer becomes.</p>

<h3>Advertising flyer mistake #4: Not asking for pass-along</h3>
<p>It's well-known that a word-of-mouth referral is the most-powerful form of advertising. So why not ask for one? It could be as simple as putting this line of copy at the bottom of your ad flyer: "If you can't use our service, please pass this flyer along to someone who can!"</p>
<p>Granted, most people, if they're not interested, will throw your flyer away. But, the cost of adding that little line of copy is exactly zero, and the potential pay-off is big because any flyer that does get passed along gains the weight of a personal referral to the secondary recipient.</p>

<h3>Advertising flyer mistake #5: Not using testimonials</h3>
<p>As well as using your own words, why not use the words of existing and happy customers? Testimonials can be a powerful inclusion in your flyer. After all, readers expect you to say only good things about yourself, so a testimonial from an independent party adds extra weight.</p>
<p>But don’t overdo it! Too many glowing reviews can seem a little suspect and too good to be true. Just a few well-chosen testimonials are all you need to show your product/service is tried and true.</p>


<h3>Advertising flyer mistake #6: Too wordy</h3>
<p>Too many words, and too much cleverness, will bore even the most attentive reader. A big block of words just suggests that your flyer or brochure is going to be plain hard work to read.</p>
<p>A good idea is to reduce your word count by 10 to 20% after you’ve written the first draft. If you have a lot to say, and just can’t take out any copy, you could always try bullet points.</p>
<p>Bullet points break up a page and make it appear less dense.</p>
<p>As a result, they are reader-friendly.</p>
<p>Bullet points are also a good way of separating different benefits.</p>
<p>Get the idea?</p>
